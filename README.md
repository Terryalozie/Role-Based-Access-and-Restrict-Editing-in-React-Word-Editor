# Role-Based Access and Restrict Editing in React Word Editor for Secure Document Workflows
This repository demonstrates how to implement role-based access control and editing restrictions in a Word document using the Syncfusion React Word Document Editor (also known as the Word Processor). It showcases a secure document workflow where different users can edit only the sections relevant to their rolesâ€”ideal for collaborative environments such as vendor agreements, contracts, or internal documentation.
